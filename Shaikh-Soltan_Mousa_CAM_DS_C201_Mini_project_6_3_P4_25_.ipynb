    "# Mini-project: Applying supervised learning to predict student dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "**Welcome to your Mini-project: Applying supervised learning to predict student dropout rate**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will examine student data and use supervised learning techniques to predict whether a student will drop out. In the education sector, retaining students is vital for the institution's financial stability and for students’ academic success and personal development. A high dropout rate can lead to significant revenue loss, diminished institutional reputation, and lower overall student satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work with the data in three distinct stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Applicant and course information\n",
    "2.  Student and engagement data\n",
    "3.  Academic performance data\n",
    "\n",
    "These stages reflect Study Group’s real-world data journey and how student information has progressed and become available. Additionally, this approach enables you, through data exploration, to support Study Group in better understanding and identifying key metrics to monitor. This approach will also assist you in determining at which stage of the student journey interventions would be most effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please set aside approximately **12 hours** to complete the mini-project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business context\n",
    "Study Group specialises in providing educational services and resources to students and professionals across various fields. The company's primary focus is on enhancing learning experiences through a range of services, including online courses, tutoring, and educational consulting. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and a team of experienced educators, Study Group aims to bridge the gap between traditional learning methods and the evolving needs of today's learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Study Group serves its university partners by establishing strategic partnerships to enhance the universities’ global reach and diversity. It supports the universities in their efforts to attract international students, thereby enriching the cultural and academic landscape of their campuses. It works closely with university faculty and staff to ensure that the universities are prepared and equipped to welcome and support a growing international student body. Its partnership with universities also offers international students a seamless transition into their chosen academic environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Study Group runs several International Study Centres across the UK and Dublin in partnership with universities with the aim of preparing a pipeline of talented international students from diverse backgrounds for degree study. These centres help international students adapt to the academic, cultural, and social aspects of studying abroad. This is achieved by improving conversational and subject-specific language skills and academic readiness before students progress to a full degree programme at university.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through its comprehensive suite of services, it supports learners and universities at every stage of their educational journey, from high school to postgraduate studies. Its approach is tailored to meet the unique needs of each learner, offering personalised learning paths and flexible scheduling options to accommodate various learning styles and commitments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Study Group's services are designed to be accessible and affordable, making quality education a reality for many individuals. By focusing on the integration of technology and personalised learning, the company aims to empower learners to achieve their full potential and succeed in their academic and professional pursuits. Study Group is at the forefront of transforming how people learn and grow through its dedication to innovation and excellence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Study Group has provided you with 3 data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "By the end of this mini-project, you will have developed the skills and knowledge to apply advanced machine learning techniques to create a predictive model for student dropout. This project will involve comprehensive data exploration, preprocessing, and feature engineering to ensure high-quality input for the models. You will employ and compare multiple predictive algorithms, such as XGBoost, and a neural network-based model, to determine the most effective model for predicting student dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Notebook, you will:\n",
    "- explore the data sets, taking a phased approach\n",
    "- preprocess the data and conduct feature engineering\n",
    "- predict the dropout rate using XGBoost, and a neural network-based model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also write a report summarising the results of your findings and recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessment criteria\n",
    "By completing this project, you’ll be able to provide evidence that you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- develop accurate predictions across diverse organisational scenarios by building and testing advanced ML models\n",
    "- inform data-driven decision-making with advanced machine learning algorithms and models\n",
    "- propose and present effective solutions to organisational problems using data preprocessing, model selection, and insightful analysis techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project guidance\n",
    "1.   Navigate to **Mini-project 6.3 Applying supervised learning to predict student dropout**, and save a copy of the activity Notebook to your Drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Please refer to the Rubric for specific steps to be performed as part of the project activity. Every step mentioned in the rubric will be assessed separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When you’ve completed the activity:\n",
    "  - download your completed Notebook as an IPYNB (Jupyter Notebook) or PY (Python) file\n",
    "  - save the file as follows: **LastName_FirstName_CAM_C201_Week_6_Mini-project**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Prepare a detailed report (800–1,000 words) that includes an overview of your approach, a description of your analysis, and an explanation of the insights you identified - Please refer to the Rubric for further details that should form a part of your analysis and report. Save the document as a PDF named according to the following convention: **LastName_FirstName_CAM_C201_W6_Mini-project.pdf**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Submit your Notebook and PDF document.\n",
